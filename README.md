# Let's Rock, Baby!  

Hi, I'm **_Luis Ya√≠r S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez_** but you can call me **_D√°libur_** and this is a short presentation about me.

## About me
I'm student at the Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana studying computer engineering.  
The main reason why I decided to study this career is because I love video games and at some point I wanted to be a tester or a developer but over time and with what I have been learning I have become more interested in other areas such as:  
- Big Data
- Artificial intelligence
- Databases
- Data mining
- Mobile development (more Android)
- IoT
- and who knows what else
